------------------
Iguana provides several interfaces with many calls.
Since the Iguana server is the root server it can do many
things that other programs cannot such as create new threads,
map pages and create address spaces. Other processes use
these many RPC calls to ask Iguana to perform these actions
on its behalf.

Note that the Iguana API is pretty fluid and this implementation
differs a bit from that in Okl4 1.4.1.1 and other published
versions.  Compare this file for example with
okl4 1.4.1.1 libs/iguana/include/interfaces/iguana.idl4



---
iguana_ex_pagefault(ip, sp, priv, out fp)
  page fault notification from kernel
  iguana handles page faults on behalf of its clients...


---
iguana_pd_mypd()
  returns the pd associated with the caller

iguana_pd_create_pd
  create and return a capability to a new pd parented by the caller

iguana_pd_create_thread(pd, priority, out tid)
  create a new thread under pd with given priority
  returns a capability to the new thread, and the thread id.

iguana_pd_create_eas(pd, kip, utcb, pid, out id)
  create an external address space, specifying where to map
  the kip and the utcb.  
  Returns a capability to the external address space and the l4id in id.

igauna_pd_create_session(pd, client, server, clist)
  create a new session owned by pd from client to server using clist
  Returns a capability to the new session

iguana_pd_set_callback(pd, cbBuf)
  associates cbBuf as the callback buffer for pd
  returns nothing

iguana_pd_add_clist(pd, clist)
  maps the clist into the pd, adds it to the pd's clists
  returns a reference to the clistinfo or zero

iguana_pd_release_clist(pd, clist, slot)
  ignores slot
  removes clist from pd
  returns nothing

iguana_pd_delete(pd)
  delete the pd
    skips the response if the caller is pd
  returns nothing

iguana_pd_create_restricted_pd(pd)
  create a new pd parented by pd
  restrict its IPC to talk to itself and its parent
  return a capability to the new pd

---
iguana_thread_id(tidp)
  return a thread reference given an l4 thread id (pointer)

iguana_thread_l4id(thread)
  return the l4 thread id for thread

iguana_thread_xxx_set_name(id, name)
  note: if name is larger than 40 bytes a buffer overflow will occur
  store (id,name) into a 64-entry table (or fail)
  returns nothing

iguana_thread_xxx_get_byname(name)
  find name in the 64-entry table
  return the matching id or 0

iguana_thread_xxx_delete_name(id)
  find id in the 64-entry table 
    set its id to zer0
    set its string to 40 bytes of "0" (0x30)
  return 0 for success or -1 for failure

iguana_thread_start(thr, ip, sp)
  start a thread running
  returns nothing

iguana_thread_delete(thr)
  delete the thread
  returns nothing, skips the response if caller is thr

iguana_thread_set_exception(thr, exc, sp, ip)
  note: buffer overflow if exc is not zero or one!
  sets thread's exception[exc] to (sp,ip)
  returns nothing

--
iguana_hardware_register_interrupt(hw, handler, irq)
  note: performs no security checks
  ignores the hw arg
  sets the handler for irq to handler
  returns (whatever L4_ThreadControl returns...)

iguana_hardware_back_memsection(hw, msection, paddr, attrs)
  note: performs no security checks and can be used to access
    any memory in the system!
  maps physical memory at paddr into the memsection using
  the provided attributes.
  returns 0 for success or -1 for failure
