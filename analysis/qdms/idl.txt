------------

This server seems to deal with setting up shared memory
sections between clients and servers for direct memory access
between them.  In addition to memory sections for clients and
servers there also seems to be some global shared memory sections
or possibly sections designed for direct interaction with iguana?



register_server(obj) :
  - creates a memsection
  - registers qdms as server for that memsection
  - creates a session to obj
  - provides session access to the memsection, an "upstream_shared_queue"
    and an "iguana_server_queue"
  - returns the memsection

register_cmd_server(obj) :
  - creates a session to obj
  - provides session access to the memsection of the reigstered server
  ... more ...
    walks some table and grants access to more things...
  - returns 1 on success

register_client(cl, srv) :
  - if cl is zero, use the tid of the sender as cl
  - lookup cl in client table, if it doesnt yet exist
    - create a memory section
    - register qdms as the server for the section
    - create a session to srv
    - provide the session access to the memsection
  - return the memsection for cl, or zero

deregister_client(cl) :
  - if cl is zero, use the tid of the sender as cl
  - find cl in the client table
    - delete its session and memsection 
  - return 1 on success, 0 on failure


open_client(cl, flags) :
  - find client in table, fail if not found
  - if flag 2 set, share the upstream shared queue with client session
  - if flag 1 set,
    - create a memsection, register it, share it to session
      (possibly sharing it to the cmdServer's session too)
  - return the clients memsection base


close_client(cl) :
  - find client in table
    - revoke access to sessions...
    .. more
  - return the clients memsection base or zero


open_iguana_server_client():
  doesnt seem terribly useful.  It records the peer, but nothing
  ever references the data after it is stored (!?)
  - if already registered, return 0
  - otherwise register caller thread as the iguana_server_client
  - return <some field>
