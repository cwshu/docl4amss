-----

17C1D098 + n * 0x18010   seems important.
   sometimes "DATA ERR" is stored at offset 8 there to mark important states
   buffer at offset 0x14 has 0x18000 bytes of storage for error reporting


user defined handle is used to store the "rex_curr_task"

----


several error logging mechanisms exist
XXX fill out details

  - captured error state including registers and stack
  - two error log with string messages
  - a log buffer with unformatted error messages
    (ie. fmt plus each of the args is saved there)

XXX fill out details of debugging flags
   globBufPos
   globBufPos2
storeErr

   dbgBuf , dbgBufPos, dbgBufPos2
  reportErr*
  die*

has a dpc thread that calls defered procedure calls

-------------------

16E6458C initHeapInfo  
   sets up heap at 0x01f0.0000 and expects it to have some info
   but in emulator I'm getting it all zero'd.  Is the loader
   or APP supposed to be initializing these fields for us?


-----------------
smem stuff is partially documented in linux code
arch/arm/mach-msm/smd*.[ch]

ie. smd.c smem_alloc, smem_item and smem_find have
direct correspondants in the amss code, though the
amss code sets up some data structs with tables that
are not needed inthe linux code...
