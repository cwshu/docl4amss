server.c        - reconstruction of some of the IDL generated server code

ig_naming2      - elf for the ig_naming process (extracted from radio.img)
ig_naming2.idb  - IDA analysis of ig_naming2


The ig_naming process is compiled from open source code (although
a slightly different version).  The IDB here analyzes the
binary by matching it up as closely as possible to the public code.
This should provide a good basis for identifying libraries used
in other binaries.
